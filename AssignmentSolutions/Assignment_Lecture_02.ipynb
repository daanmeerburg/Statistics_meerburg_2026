    "The [Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in [1975](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.1975.10479121). It became famous as a question from reader Craig F. Whitaker's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's \"Ask Marilyn\" column in Parade magazine in 1990.\n",
